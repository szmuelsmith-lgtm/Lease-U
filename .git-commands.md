# Git Commands to Run Locally

Since you're at school and can't install packages, here are the git commands to run when you get home or have access:

## Initial Setup (if git not initialized):

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Lease U web app with Next.js, Prisma, NextAuth"
```

## If you already have a remote repository:

```bash
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## If you need to create a new GitHub repo:

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Create a new repository named "lease-u" (or your preferred name)
3. Copy the repository URL
4. Run:
```bash
git remote add origin <your-repo-url>
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

## Quick Commands:

```bash
# Check status
git status

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Your commit message"

# Push to remote
git push
```

## Important Files Already Ignored:

- `node_modules/` - Dependencies (don't commit)
- `.next/` - Next.js build files
- `prisma/*.db` - Database files
- `.env` - Environment variables (keep `.env.example`)
